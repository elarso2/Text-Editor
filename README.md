# Text-Editor

[![MIT Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://mit-license.org/)

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to build a Text Editor which allows users to write short notes or snippets of code, and develop it as a Progressive Web Application in order to allow users to utilize this application both on and offline. In order to do this, I had to utilize Webpack and build service worker and manifest plugins in my webpack.congif.js file.

## Dependencies

Many npm packages were necessary for this project, but the most notable ones were:

- IDB,
- Express,
- Concurrently,
- Webpack

## Demonstration

My live application can be viewed on [Heroku](https://ell-text-editor.herokuapp.com/).

In this image you can see my site once it has been installed, with the application icon on my desktop, along with Manifest data:
